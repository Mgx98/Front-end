      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>The station was constructed on February 9, 1968. The station is very high and has a fairly impressive structure. The station hall "floats" above the street level, directly below the platforms. Exits connect the hall directly with the tram stop. Two lifts, which were not part of the original design of the station and were installed later, lead directly from the platforms to the street.</p>
